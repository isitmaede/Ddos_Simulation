## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**This tool is a pure UI/UX simulation.** It does not perform any actual network attacks, DDoS, or unauthorized requests. It is designed for educational purposes, cinematography, and cybersecurity demonstrations to visualize how network stress might look in a controlled terminal environment.

## 📌 Features
- **Top-Tier CLI UI:** Built with the `Rich` library for high-fidelity terminal rendering.
- **Dynamic Stress Simulation:** Simulates request buffering, latency spikes, and server exhaustion.
- **IsItMaede Engine:** Personalized branding for security research demonstrations.
- **Real-time Logs:** Visualizes "mock" packet delivery with accurate timestamps.
