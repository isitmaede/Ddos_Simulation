## 🎀 ⚠️ Gentle Reminder (Disclaimer) 🎀
**Please be kind!** 🌸 This tool is a **pure UI/UX simulation**. It does *not* send any mean packets or perform actual network attacks. It is purely designed for aesthetic cinematography, pranks, and cybersecurity demonstrations to visualize how network stress might look in a controlled, sparkly terminal environment. No servers were actually hurt in the making of this script! (◡‿◡✿)

## ✨ Super Cool Features ✨
- **🍭 Kawaii-Tier CLI:** Powered by the `Rich` library to make your terminal look like an absolute dream.
- **🚀 Turbo Stress Simulation:** Watch the requests go *nyoom* until the server-kun needs a nap.
- **💜 IsItMaede Signature:** Crafted with the most aesthetic and professional terminal engine.
- **🕒 Sparkly Logs:** Real-time diagnostics visualization with super-accurate timestamps.
